# Proposal: Ramapo-Pine Barrens National Park and Conservation Corridor

*This proposal is in response to the Reddit discussion: [You can pick any 233,000 acres of land within the continental USA to be the next National Park, where are you choosing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalPark/comments/1dshvhz/you_can_pick_any_233000_acres_of_land_within_the/)*

## Overview

This proposal suggests creating a 233,000-acre National Park stretching from the Ramapo Mountains to the New Jersey Pine Barrens, introducing a new model for conservation in America.

## The Landscape

- **Ramapo Mountains (NY/NJ)**: 100,000 acres
  - Hidden gem of the Appalachians
  - Rugged trails and diverse forests

- **New Jersey Pine Barrens**: 133,000 acres
  - Unique ecosystem with rare species
  - Natural cranberry bogs

## Ecological Significance

- Diverse habitats supporting numerous threatened and endangered species
- Critical water resources, including the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer
- Varied ecosystems from Appalachian forests to rare Pine Barrens

## Cultural and Historical Value

- Native American heritage sites
- Revolutionary War landmarks
- Industrial archaeology, including historic iron furnaces

## Innovative Conservation Model

### 1. NPS-Endorsed Land Trust Network
- Create a mosaic of protected areas linking the Ramapos to the Pine Barrens
- Engage private landowners in conservation efforts

### 2. Wildlife Corridor Creation
- Connect fragmented habitats to enhance species migration and survival
- Boost ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change

### 3. Community Integration
- Increase public access to nature near major population centers
- Promote sustainable tourism to boost local economies

## A New Paradigm in Conservation: The Stein-Inspired Rewilding Initiative

As a groundbreaking addition to this proposal, we introduce a community-based rewilding program inspired by Sara Stein's "Noah's Garden" concept:

### 1. NPS-Endorsed Neighborhood Rewilding
- Encourage communities to restore native flora and fauna in residential areas
- Provide NPS resources and expertise for rewilding efforts

### 2. Tiered Certification System
- Develop an NPS endorsement program similar to LEED or TRUE certifications
- Offer Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum levels based on rewilding achievements

### 3. Criteria for Certification
- Percentage of native plant species
- Habitat creation (e.g., pollinator gardens, bird sanctuaries)
- Removal of invasive species
- Water conservation measures
- Community education and engagement

### 4. Benefits of Certification
- Official NPS recognition and signage
- Access to exclusive NPS resources and expert consultations
- Community pride and increased property values
- Collective contribution to larger ecosystem health

## Conclusion

The Stein-Inspired Rewilding Initiative would extend the park's impact far beyond its boundaries, creating a network of micro-habitats that support the larger ecosystem. It represents a revolutionary approach to conservation, actively involving communities in the stewardship of their local environments while contributing to the broader goals of the National Park System.

By combining traditional park preservation with innovative community-based conservation, the Ramapo-Pine Barrens National Park and Conservation Corridor could set a new standard for environmental stewardship in the 21st century.
